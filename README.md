# Pong Simulation using NEAT
This project contains a simulation of the popular game 'Pong' created with Pygame, and automated using the 'NEAT' library. The simulation uses the NEAT algorithm where every generation there are 100 competitors, the best of them survives and is passed on to the next generation. Additionally, there is also a visualization of the neural network of the best performer. This simulation is totally independent and can be usefull for people who wants to improve their skills on pygame and or neat library.

## Dependencies
- Pygame
- Neat-python

## Instructions
Install Pygame and Neat-python by running pip install pygame and pip install neat-python on your terminal.
